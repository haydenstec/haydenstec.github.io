In my new role as a Research Programmer for CMU, I provide for all the technical needs of Dr. Bruce McLaren's "McLearn Lab" in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Our lab primarily researches educational games and intelligent tutoring systems, collaborating with researchers around the world to investigate these educational tools from neurological, gender studies, educational data mining, and many other perspectives.
